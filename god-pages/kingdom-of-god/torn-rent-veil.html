<h2>The Veil Torn</h2>
<p>
Within the courts of Solomon’s grace, <br>
Two realms stood still, face to face—<br>
The Holy Place of thought and sight,<br>
The Holy of Holies, veiled from light.
</p><p>
A curtain hung, both thick and deep,<br>
Guarding dreams the soul would keep;<br>
<a href="../../sin.html">Doubt</a> its thread, belief its seam,<br>
Shutting out the shaping dream.
</p><p>
Yet on the hill, when Christ did cry,<br>
The veil was rent from earth to sky;<br>
No longer bound by fear’s command,<br>
Man’s will could touch the promised land.
</p><p>
Jachin stood, declaring, <em>I AM!</em>,<br>
Boaz roared with courage’s flame;<br>
Two pillars strong, now free to press<br>
Desire’s form to fruitfulness.
</p><p>
The womb received, the seed was sown,<br>
Imagination claimed its throne;<br>
Faith and strength, as man and bride,<br>
Joined as one, no more divide.
</p><p>
Now every prayer, if held as true,<br>
Flows from the mind to make it new;<br>
For when the veil is torn away,<br>
What we believe becomes our day.
</p>

<h2>The Veil is Rent</h2>
<p>
Lo, the veil was rent in twain,<br>
From summit high to lowest plain.
</p><p>
Jachin saith, "I AM, I stand",<br>
Boaz giveth strength of hand.
</p><p>
Faith and might, in union meet,<br>
Bride and groom, their work complete.
</p><p>
That which is ask’d, believ’d, is done—<br>
The veil is gone; the <a href="../../love.html">two are one.</a>
