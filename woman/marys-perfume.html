  <h1>Mary's Perfume</h1><div class="page">

<p>
  
<a href="../woman.html">She</a> did not wait for tomb or stone, <br>
but came while breath was still her own.<br>
With tender hands and silent grace,<br>
she touched His feet, not His face.
</p><p>
A vial broke — the room was filled<br>
with <a href="../love.html">sweetness</a> none could bottle or build.<br>
She spoke no word, but love was there,<br>
in <a href="../love/ever-adore-thee.html">perfume rising through the air</a>.
</p><p>
Judas scolded, silver-eyed,<br>
but love had nothing left to hide.<br>
The cost was high — and gladly spent;<br>
her heart, her oil, her worship went.
</p><p>
The Song had said: His name is poured,<br>
like fragrant oil the soul adored.<br>
And so she poured — and so He knew:<br>
a crown of scent, before the dew.
</p><p>
Let others wait till death has come —<br>
she crowned Him early, and was done.<br>
And now her name, like perfume rare,<br>
still lingers soft upon the air.

   <small>— John 12</small></p>
