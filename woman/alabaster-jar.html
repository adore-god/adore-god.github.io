  <h1>The Alabaster Jar</h1><div class="page">

She broke the vessel of her past,<br /> And poured it out on Love at last.<br /> No Pharisee could see within,<br /> That love itself undoes the sin. <br /><br />For sin is but a thought once kept,<br /> A state assumed, where sorrow wept;<br /> But faith in Love creates anew—<br /> The self forgiven, pure, and true. <br /><br />

<h2 class="sub">Your Sins Are Forgiven</h2> 

"Then turning toward the woman he said to Simon, “Do you see this woman? I entered your house; you gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with her tears and wiped them with her hair. <br> 
You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in she has not ceased to kiss my feet. <br> 
You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment. <br> 
Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven—for she loved much. But he who is forgiven little, loves little.” <br> 
And he said to her, “Your sins are forgiven.” <br> 
Then those who were at table with him began to say among themselves, “Who is this, who even forgives sins?” <br> 
And he said to the woman, “Your faith has saved you; go in peace.” <small>— Luke 7:44-50 </small>
