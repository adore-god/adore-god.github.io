  <h1>The Seed in Itself</h1><div class="page">

  <blockquote>
  “And the earth brought forth grass, and herb yielding seed after his kind, and the tree yielding fruit, whose seed was in itself, after his kind: and God saw that it was good.” <small> — Genesis 1:11 </small>
  </blockquote>
<p>
<span class="vintage-first-line">Each little thing begins so small,</span> <br> 
A tender seed, the cause of all.<br> 
It does not shout, it makes no sound —<br> 
But quietly brings the world around.
</p><p>
The seed is hidden, soft and meek,<br> 
Yet grows the life our hearts do seek.<br> 
What we believe with quiet grace<br> 
Will blossom in its rightful place.<br> 
</p><p>
The world is shaped by <a href="man.html"><em>what we hold<br> 
In secret thoughts</em></a>, both shy and bold.<br> 
No need to strive or look afar —<br> 
The seed is where the treasures are.
</p><p>
A fearful heart will plant with care<br> 
What brings about more grief or scare.<br> 
But happy thoughts, and love held dear,<br> 
Will grow a life both sweet and clear.
</p><p>

So tend your thoughts, your inner ground —<br> 
With gentle joy, and truth profound.<br> 
For every dream your heart has kissed<br> 
Begins with seed — and <a href="woman.html"> will exist.</a><br> 

</p>

<blockquote>
“I have planted, Apollos watered; but God gave the increase.”
<small>— 1 Corinthians 3:6</small>
